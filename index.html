I am an ASIC Engineer at NVIDIA's streaming multiprocessor (GPU core) team. My responsibilities involve understanding the functionality of new architectural features and implementing them in software functional models of units that interact with the GPU core for simulation. I also solve unforeseen issues in the GPU core micro-architecture that often accompany the implementation of these architectural enhancements.

Stanford EE MS focus: Machine Learning, Computer Graphics, Computer Architecture.
UIUC EE BS focus: Computer Architecture, Operating Systems, Digital Design, Analog Circuits and Signal Processing.
