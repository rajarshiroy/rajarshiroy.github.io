I am an ASIC Engineer at NVIDIA's streaming multiprocessor (GPU core) team. My responsibilities involve 
understanding the functionality of new architectural features and implementing them in software functional models 
of units that interact with the GPU core for simulation. I also solve unforeseen issues in the 
GPU core micro-architecture that often accompany the implementation of these architectural enhancements.
